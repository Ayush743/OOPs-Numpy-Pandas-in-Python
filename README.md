# 🏗 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Classes & Objects** – Understanding the core building blocks of OOP.  
✅ **Encapsulation** – Data hiding, getters, and setters for controlled access.  
✅ **Inheritance** – Code reusability and hierarchical relationships.  
✅ **Polymorphism** – Method overloading and overriding.  
✅ **Abstraction** – Defining abstract classes and interfaces.  
✅ **Magic Methods & Operator Overloading** – Enhancing class functionality with special methods.  
✅ **Composition & Aggregation** – Understanding alternative OOP design approaches.  
✅ **Multiple Inheritance & MRO** – Managing complex class relationships.  
✅ **Design Patterns** – Implementing common OOP design patterns for scalability.
